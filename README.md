# Tetris_game

This repository contains a simple 3D Tetris well rendered using [three.js](https://threejs.org/). The scene shows the well from a top-down perspective with green grid lines and wireframe walls.

The demo now includes a falling cube that can be moved left or right with the arrow keys. Once the cube reaches the bottom it changes colour and a new cube spawns at the top. The game ends if no room is available for a new cube.

## How to view

Open `src/index.html` in a modern web browser. The page loads three.js from a CDN and renders the Tetris well.
