# Tetris_game

This repository contains a simple 3D Tetris well rendered using [three.js](https://threejs.org/). The scene shows the well from a top-down perspective with a green grid on the floor and wireframe walls. The playfield measures 5Ã—5 cells and is 12 cells deep. Future steps will expand the project into a full game.

## How to view

Open `src/index.html` in a modern web browser. The page loads three.js from a CDN and renders the Tetris well.
