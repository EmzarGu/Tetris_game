# Tetris_game

This repository contains a simple 3D Tetris well rendered using [three.js](https://threejs.org/). The scene is viewed from directly above the centre of the well so the bottom appears as a small square. All five inner surfaces (floor and four walls) are drawn using green grid lines. The playfield measures 5Ã—5 cells and is 12 cells deep. Future steps will expand the project into a full game.

## How to view

Open `src/index.html` in a modern web browser. The page loads three.js from a CDN and renders the Tetris well.
