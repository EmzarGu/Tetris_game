# Tetris_game

This repository contains a simple 3D Tetris well rendered using [three.js](https://threejs.org/). The scene shows the well from a top-down perspective with green grid lines and wireframe walls. Future steps will expand the project into a full game.

## How to view

Open `src/index.html` in a modern web browser. The page loads three.js from a CDN and renders the Tetris well.
